# Image blending with OpenCV
Welcome to this lab in the computer vision course [TEK5030](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/its/TEK5030/) at the University of Oslo.
We are here going to play with image blending using Laplacian pyramids with OpenCV.

**Start** by cloning this repository on your own machine. 
Then, open the project in PyCharm.
If you are uncertain about how this is done, please take a look at [lab-intro](https://github.com/tek5030/lab-intro/blob/master/py/lab-guide/1-open-project-in-pycharm.md).

The lab is carried out by following this notebook:
- [Implement image blending](lab-image-blending.ipynb)

When appropriate, you can take a look at our proposed solution:
- [Our solution to "Implement image blending"](solution-image-blending.ipynb)
